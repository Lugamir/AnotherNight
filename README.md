## Notes

- Package Structure (initial) Commit *~ by Tem*  
	- [Git will **not** push empty packages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16675784/git-didnt-push-empty-folders/16675971) so I filled em up with placeholders from my other project  
	- Those placeholders can be beneficial as templates for future work  
	- They may be deleted if the package in question has at least one other file in it  
	- I have removed tons of misleading content so the whole thing is a bit easier on the eyes  
	- Not sure how you guys feel about all this so if you insist we can remove all classes and start from scratch, no pressure :)  
	- P.S. I kinda lost control and added much more than needed...  


- Resources (res) Folder *~ by Tem*  
	- audio is for audio  
	- backdrops is for backdrops  
	- textures is for... sprites
